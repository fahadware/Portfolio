    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Fahad, currently Persuing Bachelor of Computer Science at FAST-NUCES, and an aspiring Full-Stack Engineer passionate about building powerful, real-world web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 💻</p>
    <p>I’m following a roadmap that’s shaping me step by step:
    Starting with MERN development → growing into DevOps for automation, CI/CD, and cloud systems → and ultimately aiming to integrate AI/ML into the products I build.</p>
    <p> As I explore Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, my goal is to combine smart algorithms with full-stack development to build intelligent, efficient, and scalable solutions that can solve real-world problems.</p>
    <p>I’m currently focused on both frontend and backend development, learning how to manage servers, APIs, and databases — while also getting hands-on with tools like Git and cloud platforms.</p>
    <p> With a passion for design and code, I enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces and smooth user experiences that not only look good but work great.</p>
    <p>⚙️ Tools I work with: React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, Git, GitHub, REST APIs</p>
    <p>🌐 Exploring how to bridge development, deployment, and intelligence through AI/ML integration.</p>
    <p>Let’s connect and collaborate! I'm always excited to work on new ideas, solve interesting problems, and grow with like-minded people in tech.</p>
